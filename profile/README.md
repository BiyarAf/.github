## 🏩 BiyārAf

**Empowering Local Afghan Communities Through Technology Without Requiring Tech.**

---

### 📌 About Us

**BiyārAf** is a community-driven tech organization based in **Kabul, Afghanistan**. Our mission is to bridge the gap between technology and people who don’t—or can’t—use it directly. We create human-powered, tech-enabled systems that solve real problems for locals, especially workers, vendors, freelancers, and families, using tools as simple as **phone calls**.

We bring tech **to the streets, not just the screens.**

---

### 🚀 What We Do

* ✅ Build offline-first solutions for Afghan society
* ✅ Connect service providers (vendors, workers, freelancers) with customers—without apps
* ✅ Collect, organize, and maintain accurate local data
* ✅ Create employment opportunities in data collection, customer support, and logistics
* ✅ Use Streamlit, MongoDB, Python, and other tools to power our systems behind the scenes

### 📱 Our Flagship Project — **Biyār**

> "Biyār" (بیار) means **"Bring it"** in Dari.

🔹 A phone-call–based assistant system that helps Afghans find the right service or person for any task.

🔹 Local data collectors roam neighborhoods and register shops, services, and workers using a digital form.

🔹 Operators help callers (in Pashto or Dari) find what they need via human support + smart search.

🔹 Reviews, availability, and accuracy are constantly updated.
